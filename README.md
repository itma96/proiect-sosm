# proiect-sosm

My name is Ionescu-Tautu Mihai-Andrei and for my SOSM project I developed an e-store app consisting of the following: 
* a rest-based web-service for fetching the list of available products (catalog-service)
* a webserver for displaying/ordering products (catalog-webapp)
* a mobile app that uses both the web-service and the server (Catalog)

In terms of databases, I used a local mysql instance that is mirrored on the android side for app caching/offline-availability. The web-service and server were developed using Java technologies (jaxrs, jetty, jsp etc) and the mobile app was done using the Android SDK.
